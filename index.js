* #6c Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:

* Declare a variable named generalContainer. This variable will be used to store multiple types of
* values as we `assign` them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.
*
* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each 
* assignment statement to show the current value.
